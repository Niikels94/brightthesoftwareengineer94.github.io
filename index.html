								<p>I am a software engineer born and raised in Accra, Ghana. Like most people around the world, I found myself in a profession that didn’t bring any fulfillment to my being. However, as life will have it, in my constant search for my real passion, I came across ALX which turned my life around completely. I am now on course to attain an enviable career in software engineering, and I couldn’t be happier and prouder that I decided to make that switch.
									ALX is a software engineering platform that sort to build young hungry individuals who are willing to take that step toward changing the course of their lives. ALX in conjunction with the Holberton school provided tailor-made projects based on international standards and curriculum which offered exciting challenges to its students.
									I chose to study at ALX to build a solid programming foundation and become a better, more well-rounded software engineer. My motivation comes from seeing my progress in tangible ways which is one reason I enjoy programming so much. Seeing code speed, cleanliness, documentation, etc. demonstrably improve as I learn, and gain experience motivates me to progress more and more. Along with that, I’ve learned from tutoring and my time at ALX how important and enjoyable exchanging knowledge is. That is why my favorite projects have been group and partner projects where my ideas grow and improve through collaboration and exposure to different perspectives.
									Today I know the real meaning of hard work and dedication and all thanks to the ALX initiative.  At ALX, I was made to understand the importance of a growth mindset, that the mind can attain any height only if you are willing to put in the work. Thanks to this platform, I have learned some new soft skills which have improved my communication skills, presentation skills, and my interpersonal relationships. Unlike typical classroom lectures, ALX project-based tutoring style expands our knowledge pool and challenges you to investigate, research and think, you are constantly learning new things and expanding your knowledge. At ALX, you are guarded to write your own codes and understand them. I can now write codes in C, PYTHON, MySQL, and HTML, I can also navigate through Linux system engineering, GitHub, and many computer science platforms.

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/bnb.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In this project, we were asked to build a replical of the Airbnb console using python. The goal of the project is to deploy a replica of the Airbnb Website using my server. The final version of this project will have  </p>
								<p>A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like a shell (for development and debugging) A website (front-end) with static and dynamic functionalities A comprehensive database to manage the backend functionalities An API that provides a communication interface between the front and backend of the system.</p>

								<p>In this project, we were asked to build a replical of the Airbnb website using MySQL. Only some features will be implemented and will be listed below once completed  </p>
								<p>The Command Interpreter is used to manage the whole application's functionality from the command line, such as:

									Crete a new object.
									Retrieve an object from a file, database, etc.
									Execute operation on objects. e.g. Count, compute statistics, etc.
									Update object's attributes.
									Destroy an object.</p>

								<h2 class="https://github.com/Kingloco1990/printf">printf project</h2>
								<p> In this project, i was a contributer. Primarily designed for usage in embedded systems, where printf is not available due to memory issues or in avoidance of linking against libc. Using the standard libc printf may pull a lot of unwanted library stuff and can bloat code size about 20k or is not 100% thread safe. In this cases the following implementation can be used. Absolutely NO dependencies are required, printf.c brings all necessary routines, even its own fast ftoa (floating point), ntoa (decimal) conversion.</p>
								<p>If memory footprint is really a critical issue, floating point, exponential and 'long long' support and can be turned off via the PRINTF_DISABLE_SUPPORT_FLOAT, PRINTF_DISABLE_SUPPORT_EXPONENTIAL and PRINTF_DISABLE_SUPPORT_LONG_LONG compiler switches. When using printf (instead of sprintf/snprintf) you have to provide your own _putchar() low level function as console/serial output</p>

								<h2 class="https://github.com/Habieeb/simple_shell">simple_shell project</h2>
								<p> In this project, i was a contributer. LSH is a simple implementation of a shell in C, and it is the subject of a tutorial on my website. It demonstrates the basics of how a shell works. That is: read, parse, fork, exec, and wait. Since its purpose is demonstration (not feature completeness or even fitness for casual use), it has many limitations, including:

									Commands must be on a single line.
									Arguments must be separated by whitespace.
									No quoting arguments or escaping whitespace.
									No piping or redirection.
									Only builtins are: cd, help, exit.</p>
